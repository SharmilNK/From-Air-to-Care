Stage 1 - Collect and clean multiyear NYC data from 2017-2024 (leaving out 2020-22 data during COVID years, so the model could generalize well)

Data Range : 1/1/2017 to 12/31/2024
Data Source : NYC DOHMH EpiQuery Syndromic Surveillance
-Respiratory

NOAA doesn't organize weather data by NYC boroughs - weather stations are point locations. You'll need to:
Find weather stations in each borough (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island) > Query data for each station separately > The stations may not align perfectly with borough boundaries
