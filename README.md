Forecasting Hospital Admissions for Respiratory Distress using Environmental Indicators.

Most hospitals today face a common challenge â€“ not being able to predict patient surges that cause ER strain.
Tomorrow, when air pollution spikes or a heat wave hits, emergency rooms will be overwhelmed again. We are using data from air pollution + weather + climate to forecast hospital strain 3-7 days in advance. Air pollution, weather patterns and seasonality changes are highly correlated with increased ER visits. 

This predictive model using alternative data sources will help hospitals allocate resources and reduce costs.

Build a time-stratified predictive model (pollution + weather lags) to forecast admissions in the next 3-7 days
Use open alternative datasets (OpenAQ, EPA, NOAA, NYC DOHMH)
Deliver the county wise probability for public health decision-making
